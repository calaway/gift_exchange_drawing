# Gift Exchange Drawing

## Usage

List participants in the `participants_input.txt` file, grouped by partners (so they don't draw each others' names). Then run the script.

```bash
ruby lib/gift_exchange.rb
```

Retrieve the text messages from the output directory.

## Test

```bash
bundle install

rspec
```
