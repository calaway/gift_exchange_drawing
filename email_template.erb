Merry Christmas from your gift exchange bot! My job is to randomly draw names for your Christmas gift exchange, making sure nobody draws themselves or their partner.

Please find the two people you have drawn below. I have also included the other person who drew the same recipient, so you have the option of going in on a larger gift together, or coordinate to make sure you don't buy duplicate gifts.

<%= from %>, the names you drew are:
<%= to.first %> (<%= counterpart.first %> also drew <%= to.first %>)
<%= to.last %> (<%= counterpart.last %> also drew <%= to.last %>)
