Merry Christmas from your gift exchange bot! My whole job is to draw names for your Christmas gift exchange, making sure nobody draws themselves or their partner.

Please find the two people you have drawn below. I have also included the other person who drew the same recipient so you can coordinate with them to make sure you don't both buy the same gift, or go-in on a larger gift together.

<%= from %>, the names you drew are:
<%= to.first %> (<%= counterpart.first %> also drew <%= to.first %>)
<%= to.last %> (<%= counterpart.last %> also drew <%= to.last %>)
